##  Quick start


1.  **Get to the workplace.**

    Navigate into your new api directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd default-api/
    code .
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Install the dependencies and run the server.

    ```shell
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    By default this server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`!

   
## Project Structure

    ├── routes
    ├── index.js

    ├── package.json
    ├── .gitignore
    └── README.md


1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/routes`**: This directory will contain all of the routes related codes.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`index.js`**: This is the main configuration file for for this API. 

5.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

6.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

7.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
